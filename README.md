# Privacy-Program - PET
# Privacy Attacks
  - linking attack
  - membership inference attack
  - local privacy poison attack 
  - model inversion attack 
  - white box access attack (secret sharer)
  - 
# Traditional PET 
# Anonymization or pseudoanonymization 
  - Redaction
  - Tokenization
  - Hashing
  - Generalization
  - k-anonymity, ‚Ñì-diversity, t-closeness, (Œ±,k)-anonymity, and Œ¥-presence
  - de-identification 
   
# Encryption 
  - Homomorphic encryption (PHE, SHE, FHE)
  - In-transit encryption
  - At rest encryption
  
# Zero Knowledge Proofs
  - prover, verifier, no information leakage
  - completeness, soundness, zero knowledgeness
  
# Trusted Execution  Environment (TEE) 
  - assured workloads, confidential computing, shielded VMs 
  
# Secure Multiparty Computing (MPC)

# Differential Privacy 
  - ∆ê-DP:  Random Response mechanism 
  - ∆ê-DP:  Laplace mechanism 
  - (∆ê, ùõø)-DP: Gausian mechanism
