# Privacy-Program - PET
# Traditional PET 
# Anonymization or pseudoanonymization 
  - Redaction
  - Tokenization
  - Hashing
  - Generalization
  - k-anonymity, ℓ-diversity, t-closeness, (α,k)-anonymity, and δ-presence

# Encryption 
  - Homomorphic encryption (PHE, SHE, FHE)
  - In-transit encryption
  - At rest encryption
  
# Zero Knowledge Proofs
  - prover, verifier, no information leakage
